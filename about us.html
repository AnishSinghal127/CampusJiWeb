                <h2>Our Vision</h2>
                <p>
                    To create a unified digital ecosystem that transforms the way IPM students interact with their campus community. We envision CampusJi as the central hub where every student can seamlessly access information, connect with peers, and engage with campus life. Our vision extends beyond convenience – we aim to foster transparency, enhance communication, and build stronger connections within the IPM community across all IIM campuses.

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    Our mission is to streamline campus life by consolidating fragmented systems into one intuitive platform. We are committed to addressing real student needs through innovative web solutions that simplify daily tasks – from tracking parcels and booking facilities to connecting with clubs and voicing concerns. By bridging the gap between students and campus services, we strive to create a more connected, efficient, and student-centric environment that enhances the overall IPM experience.
