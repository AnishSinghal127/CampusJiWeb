    <h1> Rationale for Website Structure and Navigation</h1>
   
    <p> A stakeholder analysis was conducted to help structure the website in accordance with the stakeholder's needs. 
        <br> A Google form survey was floated across batches of IIM Rohtak for the same. 
        <br> The questionnaire and responses can be accessed <a href= "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VVvttIW3aTCxMiVU2jQctOXqdeZq6Dtljc1VCUsVPuk/edit#responses">here.</a> </p>
    <p>
        The following results were obtained from the google form which helped us in structuring the final website:

            <th> No. </th>
            <th> Result</th>

                <td> 1.</td>
                <td> A lack of a consolidated place for essential numbers and tracking for solving hostel-level issues emerged as the foremost issues of urgency.</td>
                <td> Service tab placed immediately after the homepage.</td>
                <td> Stakeholders are our priority, and to ensure that they get their work done in the least possible time, we have formatted the webpages in order of urgency. Both grievance redressal portals and contact repository are included in the service section of the website </td>
