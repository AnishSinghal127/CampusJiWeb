    <h1> Rationale for Website Structure and Navigation</h1>
   
    <p> A stakeholder analysis was conducted to help structure the website in accordance with the stakeholder's needs. 
        <br> A Google form survey was floated across batches of IIM Rohtak for the same. 
        <br> The questionnaire and responses can be accessed <a href= "https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1VVvttIW3aTCxMiVU2jQctOXqdeZq6Dtljc1VCUsVPuk/edit#responses">here.</a> </p>
    <p>
        The following results were obtained from the google form which helped us in structuring the final website:
 <table> 
        <thead> 
            <th> No. </th>
            <th> Result</th>
            <th> Action Taken</th>
            <th> Rationale</th>
        </thead>
        <tbody> 
            <tr> 
                <td> 1.</td>
                <td> A lack of a consolidated place for essential numbers and tracking for solving hostel-level issues emerged as the foremost issues of urgency. This was followed by the problems of flipping through the parcel register to find your name, lost and found group being full, and the basketball and badminton courts never being free.</td>
                <td> Service tab placed immediately after the homepage.</td>
                <td> Stakeholders are our priority, and to ensure that they get their work done in the least possible time, we have formatted the webpages in order of urgency. All five of the stated problems are included in the service section of the website, leading to the service section naturally being put immediately after the homepage. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr> 
                <td> 2. </td>
                <td> Stakeholders prefer formal labels.</td>
                <td> Labels like "Contact Repository", "Grievance Redressal System", "Court Booking" used. </td>
                <td> Stakeholder analysis found that stakeholders prefer formal labels for easy interpretation and navigation. Thus, formal labels used. This ensures easy navigation even for someone who is new to the website. </td>
            </tr>
            <tr> 
                <td> 3. </td>
                <td> 71.7% stakeholders prefer categories/tabs for each section over having everything on the homepage, or searching through the search bar. </td>
                <td> Seperate webpages structured for different sections </td>
                <td> Stakeholders prefer separate subsections for clearer navigation. So, we structured similar contents into one heading and made separate subsections per heading. </td>
            
            </tr>
